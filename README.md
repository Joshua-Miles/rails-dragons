# rails-dragons-2

This builds on yesterdays practice project and involves many-to-many associations with Rails

# Old Deliverables:

* The ability to create, read, update and delete *Users*
* The ability to create, read, update and delete *Dragons*
* The ability to select one "master" (user) for a dragon (a user can have any number of dragons)

# *New Deliverables*
* The ability to create, read, update, and delete dragon abilities (Fire breathing, Flight, etc.)
* The ability to add any abilities to an existing dragon
* The ability to create a dragon with any number of abilities

# Instructions:
* Fork this repository
* Time yourself while working on the deliverables
* Prioritize associations (being able to select a master for a dragon)
* Commit when you hit 75 minutes
* When you have finished all deliverables, commit again and submit a pull request
* Slack me if you get stuck anywhere for more than 30 minutes.
