# rails-dragons

This builds on yesterdays practice project and involves many-to-many associations with Rails

# *New Deliverables*
* The ability to create, read, update, and delete dragon abilities (Fire breathing, Flight, etc.)
* The ability to add any abilities to an existing dragon
* The ability to create a dragon with any number of abilities

# Instructions:
* Work in your existing local repository of the project (no need to re-code what you did yesterday)
* When you have finished all deliverables, commit again and submit a pull request
* Slack me if you get stuck anywhere for more than 30 minutes.
